What is this?
-------------

``rTorrent-PS`` is a `rTorrent`_ *distribution* (*not* a fork of it),
in form of a set of patches that **improve the user experience and stability**
of official ``rTorrent`` releases.
See the `changelog`_ for a timeline of applied changes,
especially those since the last `official release`_.

Note that ``rTorrent-PS`` is *not* the same as the ``PyroScope`` `command line
utilities <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore#pyrocore>`_, and
doesn't depend on them; the same is true the other way 'round. It's just
that both unsurprisingly have synergies if used together, and some
features *do* only work when both are present.


How do I use it?
----------------

See the
`main documentation <http://rtorrent-ps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_
for details about installing and using ``rTorrent-PS``.
